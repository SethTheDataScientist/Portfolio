-Developed a new metric (PoQIT: Pocket Quality Iteration) to analyze the pocket established by the offensive line during a play using tracking data provided by the NFL.

-Combined multiple sources of data including highly-granular, complex tracking data during the ETL process.

-Completed Feature Engineering to create a series of new features that capture some more complexity of football.

-Trained both XGBOOST (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees) models on the PoQIT metric.

-Conducted a Network Shortest-Path Analysis to see which positions had the shortest Time to Close Distance between two nodes.

-Compared the Feature Importance from both models to develop a list of prescriptive steps for an NFL team to enact.
